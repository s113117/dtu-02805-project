I watched protestors tear up our city- many of the same people who professed their loved for \u201cDaddy Cuomo\u201d- saying the actions of the protestors were just because the existential threat of systemic racism was far greater than the risk of Covid. I watched those same people dance in the streets when Biden won the election. Meanwhile, I had been laid off twice at that point in 2020 because of crowd restrictions in public places, and was another month away from being laid off for a third time because of the spike of Covid cases in December of 2020. \n\nSince Biden has been elected and since his first magic trick of giving us all $1200 and then devaluing all our money by 2-3%, life here in NYC has steadily declined. I know people assaulted in the streets and on the subway. Our mayor has indicted for corruption. I grocery shop at Walmart in NJ because even the lowest quality foods in the city are ridiculously expensive. It\u2019s $20 for a cocktail around here these days. A friend of mine who opened a business here  18 months ago expected to spend $200k to flip the space, build inventory, and hire staff ended up spending $1m instead because of inflation. Meanwhile we have immigrants who came here because they wanted over the last 4 years living in Midtown Manhattan hotels- where any average New Yorker would have to pay $4-6k a month, having their groceries paid for or complaining when their free food isn\u2019t good enough. We have children who are graduating high school without basic reading and mathematical skills despite our school district spending $21,000 on every student per year. \n\nMeanwhile we are being told constantly by left leaning media that the economy has never been better. We were told Biden was sprightly and ready for four more years even though we could all see with our eyes he was deteriorating. Kamala was heavily disliked amongst my fellow liberals on July 20th but was now the hero everyone was asking for on July 21st. Now as she\u2019s campaigning she\u2019s telling people we can\u2019t have four more years of this and my colleagues nod and yassify her- even though we all know the last four years WERE HER. How am I the only person amongst the Democrats I know who sees this? \n\nEnough is enough of the gaslighting by the legacy media and I\u2019m fed up with being told to not trust my own eyes. I\u2019m sick of being told by celebrities who to vote for, while they released that insipid \u201cImagine\u201d video they made during 2020 from the comfort of their Malibu estates while I and many others were on the phone with unemployment for hours, making sure we could get money so we didn\u2019t lose our homes during a global pandemic.   I hope that many other liberals this year will see how we\u2019ve been played and will attempt to stop the cycle, like me. \n\n",

I asked her what her main concerns for Trump were so I could look into them myself. She responded with this giant text paragraph that sounded like something out of a college essay. So I put it into an AI text detector and it came back as 99% positive as AI. I asked her if she had used ChatGPT to help her answer the question and she got really offended. And then replied with another giant paragraph that also came back as 99% AI. \n\nWhen we talked on the phone, she literally had no answers to the questions I was asking her and couldn\u2019t back up anything she was saying. I was kind of shocked that she would lie about using AI to make her opinions, but after seeing how people reacted to this election, I\u2019m actually not surprised at all.  \n\nHow do you all manage these types of conversations with people who disagree with you? Most of the time I keep my mouth shut because I live in a very liberal state, but with close friends, I can\u2019t hide how I feel about the election. ",

However, this election  I've decided to vote Trump for president, and here's why:\n\n1.Jobs and Economy: I've seen many people laid off, and finding new jobs has become increasingly difficult. I experienced this firsthand, taking a long time to find work that pays significantly less than what I earned before.\n\n2.Inflation and Housing Crisis: Everything feels unaffordable now, especially housing. The rise in homelessness and the emergence of shantytowns in some places are heartbreaking, and it's sad to see so many struggling.\n\n3. Border Security: The increase in illegal border crossings poses a significant security risk, which has worsened a lot under the current administration.\n\n4. International Conflicts: We've seen multiple global conflicts escalate with no resolution in sight.\n\n5. Lack of Clear Policy: Kamala Harris hasn\u2019t articulated a concrete plan for improving our situation. In fact, she\u2019s indicated that she wouldn't have done much differently than Biden, which concerns me greatly.\n\nWhile I would love to see a woman president, I can't support Kamala Harris, as I want to avoid a repeat of the last four years. I\u2019m looking for a strong economy, a robust job market, increased border/national security, and an end to unnecessary wars. This election, I'm prioritizing policy, which is why I\u2019m voting for Trump. \n\nLet\u2019s all make our voices heard and vote! Together, we can make a difference.",

To them, it\u2019s not because Kamala Harris had no platform aside from attacking Donald Trump, it has to be because of misinformation, disinformation, racism, and sexism.\n\nHere on Reddit, you have users resorting to good old fashioned racism to denigrate and put down Hispanics, Muslims, and African American men who didn\u2019t vote for Kamala Harris.\n\nThese people still don\u2019t get why she lost.",

Over-analyzing early voting data, looking at voter demographic trends, studying spreadsheets from Iowa, reading news articles that confirm my political worldview... etc.\n\n  \nThe polls are more or less neck and neck, but as we know, the Trump voters tend to not show up in polling data, or in Wisconsin's case, lie to pollsters about who they are voting for. I expect this to be the case come Tuesday. Everyone says \"oh yeah, they're compensating for Trump this time, it will be accurate... \" blah blah. I don't buy it. We know these people look at Trump supporters with disdain. The result of the election is more important to them than journalistic integrity. They have no issue with being totally wrong three straight times.\n\n  \nRegardless, the vibe of this election just feels... different. I can't explain it. 2020 there was an unstoppable blue wall of Biden support. It felt evident even before the election, with Covid. I still thought Trump would win. \n\nWhat about 2022? Again, Democrats controlled the \"vibes\" because of the Dobbs decision, as well as garbage Trump candidates in the swing states. MAGA was a clown show at this point. \n\nAnd yet, two years later, Americans still can't afford to pay rent, illegal immigrants are still killing people, and the world is on fire. The incumbent party has offered no plan to solve this. They have even stated that they will change nothing. \n\nThis is not a victory lap. Call off work to get to the polls. Act like we're 10points down. But I can't be the only one who feels the vibe difference of this election compared to the last one. Thoughts? ",

Cheney's Endorsement is all we need to know if you are wondering who The War Machine wants in office.\n\nTrumps 2020 loss is the best thing that could of happened to this country and Trump even though we had to suffer through it for 4 long years. God Bless Trump The President of The United States of America!",

(and i say all this as a Puerto Rican who grew up in Dominican Republic and married to a Venezuelan now a resident in process to citizenship)\n\n the only reason the border is the way it is is because Joe Biden removed the regulations in place that Donald Trump had, left alone the border would have been fine.\n\nillegal immigration brings cheap labor (and the same party complains about raising the minimum wage) and open the door to get new voters if given amnesty and effectively making swing states blue states, who would not vote for the party that got me into the country, gave me money, hotels, cellphones and healthcare? \n\n  \n2) Wars: Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Hamas, the middle east in general, and now LIZ CHENEY if Harris wins.... do  i need to say more?\n\n3) Inflation and the economy: Bidenomics is working guys!, right?.....\n\n4) abortion: this and Donald trump is a fascist and the next Hitler is all the Harris campaign has, first of all Donald trump is in favor of IVF and against a national Abortion Ban, the media will be at blame if Trump doesn't win, they have amplified the lies and hoaxes of the Democratic party and brainwashed the people with fearmongering about what he might do (we already had 4 years of trump) while the republican party is concerned about what the democratic party has been doing for the past 4 years.\n\n  \nand there's more to talk about as you know....\n\n  \n  \n\n\n  \n",

        "selftext": "I remember 2020. A lot of people were confused about the sudden surge of mail in ballots. Im sure there were people here who were upset and believed that the election was rigged. Personally, i feel that it wasnt. We got out voted. It was COVID, Trump didnt deal with it very well, out we went.\n\nNow, we must go out in droves. Droves so big that no mail in ballots can overturn the red wave. That even when the mail in ballots are counted, it cant overturn the huge ED advantage. This is our moment . Get out and vote\n\n\nDream scenario: Michigan says that they will get a result by 11. Georgia and NC promises to count votes quicker.\n\nImagine if we win GA NC and MI. We dont even need to wait for the Snails in NV, PA and esp WI. The race could be over by 12 am for the first time in forever because AZ will def be red if those three states flip. \n",

        "selftext": "Trump had nearly the same amount of votes (72M in 2024 so far, 74M in 2020), while Hillary (66M in 2016) and Kamala (67M in 2024) both underperformed from Biden's win (81M in 2020). It seems highly unlikely that both the turnout overall was lower AND Trump converted people from D to R. So the loss was due to a lack of enthusiasm on the Democratic side. I know people will say it's the Comey effect for Hillary and try to lump the economy/immigration/LGBTQ rights for Harris. But that seems to be less likely given the enthusiasm bump she should have gotten from Trump's campaign antics, Roe v Wade, replacing Biden, a great VP pick, etc.\n\nCan we just admit that a good portion of this is to be due to their gender?\n\nAnd I know some people will state reasons why they didn't like her. Hillary was \"unlikeable\" and people are saying that Kamala \"didn't connect with me\", but both of those are subjective and likely due to unconscious sexism. People didn't have to say \"I'll never vote for a woman\" for it to be sexism. They could just find reasons that they didn't like Hillary/Harris that they wouldn't have found if they were men. \n\n",

Thought Helene was bad? You've doomed your fellow Americans to increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes, floods, wild fires and other extreme weather. The same goes for vulnerable countries and regions across the world. This will get worse every year, until large swathes of the US (and the world) will become inhabitable.\n\n\\- Betrayed your daughters, wives and mothers, as the GOP will strip away women's rights step by step. Same goes for any other minority in the US.\n\n\\- Very likely started a global economic war. If Trump goes ahead with his plans to put tariffs on everything, this will exacerbate a global economic war. It will increase inflation, likely increase interest rates globally, increase unemployment. You probably didn't know, but the Great Depression was caused by economic isolationism and tariffs.\n\n\\- Killed or critically wounded NATO. No European ally will trust the US from this point. We're on our own, and so are you.\n\n\\- Possibly doomed Ukraine to become a Russian vassal state. You probably don't care, because you do not possess the acumen to understand how this undermines Europe, which used to be your main allies, friends and trade partners.\n\n\\- Doomed Palestinians to an even worse genocide. The tragedy of this choice by third party candidate voters is bottomless.\n\n\\- Significantly exacerbated the decline and potential death of US democracy.\n\nYou did this because you are uninformed/misinformed, extremely cynical or just dumb. There is no excuse for what you have done, every man and woman has a responsibility to learn and understand, in order to employ your vote in the best possible way for your fellow human beings, and nature. You failed that horribly.\n\nThis is such a sad, sad day. I feel so bad for those that voted Blue, and for those that will suffer going forward. But this will badly affect the entire world, not only the US, and what you've done cannot be forgiven.\n\nWhere do we go from now? Those of us who understand history and value democracy must band together and do our utmost to defend civil rights and democracy. And hopefully, US democracy survives long enough to vote the GOP out of office after people see how badly this will go.",

I thought it might be interesting to list some of the ways Trumpers will be impacted that they probably haven't thought of yet.  I'll go first:  they can no longer get health insurance for their pre-existing conditions because Trump repealed the Affordable Care Act.  Or, they or their son is on the hook for 18 years of child support because they knocked up their girlfriend and can no longer get an abortion.  Or, they don't have any grandchildren because their daughter can't get IVF.  What are some other ones?",

        "selftext": "After the 2016 election I was, like most liberals, at a complete loss as to what happened and felt like I lacked any understanding of the American electorate. I was incredibly disappointed in my fellow Americans. I still am. But we\u2019ve had *eight years* to figure them out how to persuade them to vote this infantile sociopath out of public life. We failed miserably at doing the *things that are under control* to win. I\u2019m so sick of hearing about the things that are *not* under our control, like inflation, the economy, the right wing media, and the intelligence/ignorance/gullibility of the electorate. For the love of god can we focus on  **addressing the concerns of the American electorate* as they are, not as we want them to be, instead of constantly trying to deflect or explain them away. Even worse is chastising people for having concerns. There are always going to be external factors that influence elections. Tough sh*t. \n\nThe American electorate is **economically populist and socially moderate**. For the social progressives here, you don\u2019t have to like it but you do have to accept reality. We need a **simple and positive message that matches the will of the American electorate**. \n\nExamples:\n\n1. Immigration. \n\n\u201cWe love legal immigration. It\u2019s been the backbone of our country forever. We want a fair system where people can legally emigrate. However we will not tolerate lawlessness and will strictly enforce our borders. I wish we would have addressed this earlier but we are serious now. And by the way, we have a great bill that Republicans failed to pass.\u201d \n\n2. Inflation. \n\nYes: \u201cI know the American people are hurting. The problem is wages have not kept up with inflation. [insert populist message]\n\nNo: \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, it\u2019s slowed down to normal now!\u201d  \n\n3. Social issues. \n\nYes: \u201cYeah, some of us got a little out of hand during the pandemic era, but the Democratic Party categorically rejects the lawlessness of the defund the police movement and rejects government overreach in imposing social values on others. We reject identity politics and are here for everyone!\u201d\n\nNo: \u201cUhh, next question.\u201d \n\n4. Media/social media. \n\nYes: \u201cWe categorically reject government censorship of social media, outside of state secrets and other serious stuff like that. We are not your big brother. We believe in freedom. Yes I\u2019ll absolutely go on Joe Rogan and even light up a joint!\u201d \n\nNo: \u201canother GOP talking point - I can\u2019t believe you idiots are falling for it! Rogan!? Sounds risky!\u201d.\n\n5. Freedom. \n\n\u201cWe are the party of freedom! Let\u2019s legalize weed! Also online gambling! We will protect your porn! And obviously, a woman\u2019s right to choose! The GOP will do none of this. *They* want to be your big brother, not us.\u201d \n\n6. Trump. \n\nYes: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give a shi*t about you. He cares about golfing and doesn\u2019t even like to read.\u201d \n\nNo: \u201cHe\u2019s a fascist/racist!\u201d \n\nThe bottom line is we have to address issues as they are brought up - *even if they are brought up in bad faith* by the GOP. Deflecting and pointing out they are being brought up to manipulate and don\u2019t really matter to many people\u2019s lives - *even if true* - is an absolutely awful strategy that has played a large role in leading to this disaster. We are not being manipulated into *responding* to culture war and other issues, we are being manipulated into *not responding* and taking an actual stance on these issues because the GOP knows it looks bad when we do it. It\u2019s not that hard folks: if something seems to matter to people, address it head on with an economically populist and socially moderate standpoint. Do not deflect and externalize blame. End rant. \n\nNow let\u2019s go! ",

        "title": "My rant about the Reddit bubble and things",
        "selftext": "# **CHANGE** We can believe in\n\nLike many are, I'm frustrated by the election. But at this point I'm also frustrated by the reactions on many subs both before and after the election.\n\n## Polls\nI spent a lot of time on the main politics sub. A lot of my Reddit activity was on that sub. I had been posting that the polls were showing a close race as far back as the beginning of this year. And I reiterated that point up until election day. And every time people would respond with various excuses why the polls would be ignored. And the excuses followed an extremely predictable progression: It's too early for the polls to be accurate -> Biden hasn't started campaigning yet -> Harris just started campaigning -> The polls aren't accurate -> The polls are being flooded with bad data. The NYT came out with that one poll that people said was terrible, and should be completely ignored, because it oversampled conservative voters, which completely missed the point of what the poll was trying to accomplish.\n\n## Election Day\nAs soon as the Florida results came in and showed an unexpected hard shift to the right, I felt things looked bad. I commented that it could be a bad portent of what was to come. People were completely ignoring massive shifts in results (like Miami-Dade). But people scoffed and literally said I was dooming. On the NYT map, even before the swing states really started reporting in larger numbers, you could see the mass of red arrows indicating shifts to the right across the board. But nope, doesn't mean much because the swing states could still be different. People kept repeating that it was just like the 2020 red mirage, but completely ignored how the red mirage in that election happened in the first place (and why it wasn't happening again this election).\n\n## Voters\nPeople frequently posted questions (and are still doing it) about \"How do people *still* vote for Trump\". I think this is probably one of the major points that people just do not seem to get. Yes, Trump has a (relatively) small core of hard-core supporters. They know what he says, what his policies are and will do, and embrace it all because they want exactly that. But the vast majority of people vote for him because they have no exposure to politics. They don't know what Trump says, his policies, his actions, etc. And it's very difficult to get through to those people. How do you break through to people who ignore politics? It's a catch-22 situation. Because of this, they do not understand the rhetoric of him being an authoritarian or why his policies will be harmful.\n\nAnd this is where the left's, particularly on Reddit, messaging completely breaks down and becomes harmful. Because these people don't understand the reasons, calling them fascists or bigots has no context. They are being labeled as something for reasons that are completely unknown to them. It gives them no incentive to vote for your candidate, or vote at all, when they see one side attacking them (or what is viewed as attacking).\n\nWhat they do know is that Trump has told them he will bring about a change that will improve the aspects of their lives that are important to them. The policies are irrelevant. The actions are irrelevant. They want change.\n\nWhich brings me back to the first line:\n\n## **CHANGE** We can believe in\n\nThis was the campaign slogan for Obama in 2008. It's a brilliant slogan because it's exactly what point want: Change. The specifics don't matter. \"Change\" means different things for different people and people want change that will improve their lives. Trump's campaign pushed change. He told people what they wanted to hear, and they rewarded him for it.\n\nAnd it's also why Harris' slogan was a fucking disaster: \"We're not going back\". This is *exactly* what people want though. They want to go back to before inflation and before things cost so much. They want to go back to when people didn't call them fascists. It doesn't matter the reasons for those things happening now. What matters is what the people want. Sure, she tried to address those things, by pointing out what Biden has passed that helped the economy and protections for various civil rights. But it's a horrible campaign strategy. People do not view the economy and their own personal expenses as the same thing. Ask people how the CHIPS Act or how the BBB Act has improved their lives, you wont get an answer. So telling them that those things did is useless. And Harris ever saying that she'll continue Biden's work or do the same things was incredibly stupid. You don't tell people who are demanding change (whatever that \"change\" may be) that you're not going to change. Of course they wont vote for you then.\n\nReddit is not reality. Neither is Twitter/X, Facebook, or any other social media. No doubt they're all bubbles in their own right. But if liberals really want to encourage voters to support them, they need to stop labeling people regardless of whether it's right or wrong or true or not: It simply does not work. The last 3 elections are proof of that.\n\nRedditors need to break out of the bubble that exists here. Polling for the past 10 months gave indication that Democrats were going to have trouble, and yet were shocked when that's exactly what happened. Ignoring that did not change reality. Ignoring that people were frustrated with the state of things did not change reality. People were going to vote for Trump because of it and simply labeling them with negative titles to try and guilt them to vote for Harris accomplished nothing.\n\nPart of the problem is where people interact with others too. On Reddit, it's a lot of polar opposites: hard left with hard right. So of course it gets a bit contentious. But out in the real world it's different. If you want Average Joe to see your side, acknowledge that shit can suck right now. Both you and him probably wish groceries were cheaper. Your ideas on how to fix it likely differ, but you have to start somewhere. And just discarding him and calling him a fascist for supporting the guy who *claims* that he'll improve Joe's life sure isn't going to make Joe want to do anything you suggest to him.\n\nFixing the problems, I know, goes well beyond just getting out of the bubble. But it's a start to understanding that simply moving forward with the same mentality isn't going to suddenly work.",

It's not the only valid perspective, but there are lessons here.\n\nWe can approximate the country into four quadrants divided along two axes: pro-life/pro-choice, pro-democracy/anti-democracy. The pro-choice/pro-democracy party is the institutional Democratic Party. The pro-life/pro-democracy people explicitly aren't allowed in that club, because the Party refuses to (as they would put it) compromise on women's rights, and the pro-life crowd won't compromise on the issue either. The anti-democracy people are the institutional Republican Party, and were able to work together better regardless of their pro-life/pro-choice stance. So now we have effectively three parties, in a system built for two, and vote-splitting screws the entire pro-democracy camp.\n\nThe correct solution is for the Democratic Party to compromise on the pro-life/pro-choice axis, on an *explicitly temporary* basis. Allow pro-life candidates back into the party, on the condition that once the Democratic Party gains power in any state or at a federal level, it should immediately begin a defined program of massive systematic reform, which includes reforms that make the system function with more than two parties. (No more first-past-the-post, approval voting FTW, among other solutions.) After that, the pro-life and pro-choice wings can safely part ways, but still opportunistically cooperate, without handing the entire government over to the fascists.\n\nThe GOP became the party of Trump due to vote-splitting; he won the 2016 primary with only 40% of the votes cast. The GOP didn't fix the problem, they doubled down. Can the Democrats instead learn the lesson that the fundamental problem is our election systems, and until that gets fixed, nothing else will?",

        "selftext": "\nTrump is a victim of the system and for MAGAs he represents the way, the truth, and the life.  He is their champion!  This is the MAGA narrative.\n\nMAGAs exist in a perpetual state of denial and delusion where Trump won the 2020 election but \u201cthey\u201d stole it from him.\n\nMore than 4 years later there\u2019s not a court in the land that Trump\u2019s attorneys can convince they have any evidence of the \u201csteal.\u201d\n\nHey, maybe there\u2019s some investigative journalist who can name names and sell a book describing exactly how and who pulled off the \u201csteal.\u201d\nThe American public is still waiting for that blockbuster but for MAGAs there is no need.  In their hearts they believe in Trump, their warrior victim.\n\nNext, Trump was unfairly charged and convicted in the NY case. \n\nAgain, \u201cthey\u201d framed him. \nAlthough 12 jurors found him guilty, MAGAs convince themselves that the jurors must have been all evil DEMs and possibly paid off by Joe Biden and Alvin Bragg.\n\nRaping women doesn\u2019t help Trump\u2019s image either, but MAGAs will swear he\u2019s not really a rapist.\n\nA judge has now clarified that Trump IS a rapist.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/trump-carroll-judge-rape/\n\nThe judge clarified that the word is basically a legal distinction without a real-world difference. \nHe says that what the jury found Trump did was in fact rape, as commonly understood. \nThe filing from Judge Lewis A. Kaplan came as Trump\u2019s attorneys have sought a new trial and have argued that the jury\u2019s $5 million verdict against Trump in the civil suit was excessive. \nThe reason, they argue, is that sexual abuse could be as limited as the \u201cgroping\u201d of a victim\u2019s breasts. Kaplan roundly rejected Trump\u2019s motion Tuesday, calling that argument \u201centirely unpersuasive.\u201d\n\nBut MAGAs do what MAGAs always do.  They always create an alternative reality in order to avoid the painful truth.\n\nIt seems like it was just yesterday MAGAs were pushing another alternative reality in their \u201creverse universe\u201d where up is down and black is white. \n\nMAGAs ran around repeating their MAGA narrative that Kamala Harris could hardly talk without a teleprompter and Trump would obviously rip her to shreds in a debate.\n\nSo Trump debates Harris and surprise, surprise!  Harris dances rings around Trump who can\u2019t even look at her while she scolds him like a naughty schoolboy, telling him he is a disgrace! \n\nMeanwhile, when Trump gets his chance: \n\u201cThey\u2019re eating the dogs!\u201d\n\nNutzo, right?\n\nNot for MAGAs. For MAGAs he sounded like Abraham Lincoln giving the  Gettysburg Address. \n\nIt\u2019s the MAGA reverse-universe!  \n\nThey\u2019re an amazing study of cult behavior; frightening, fascinating, crazy, comical, disgusting and dangerous all at once.

But for me the NYT in the past helped me grasp the zeitgeist of what's happening in today's society.\n\nGiven the NYT coverage of Trump's failings and the complete non-impact of its articles and analysis on the election outcome, I can't help but feel the NYT is no longer a relevant media source for what's happening. It really just captures a certain bubble of news and zero editorial impact on conversation. Their investigative journalism has mostly uncovered information that people just don't care about.\n\nI'm thinking about canceling my subscription as a result. Anyone else feel the same?",

How do you win an election when 60%-65% of all women and 80%-85% of people of color vote for the other candidate?\n\nAdd to that the other voters Trump has lost including REPUBLICANS because of Jan 6 and on and on.\n\nAnswer: You don\u2019t.\n\nThe math is what it is.  Now here\u2019s the common sense argument:\n\nTrump loses because he has consistently alienated essential sections of the population that he needs to win.\n\n1.\t\u2060Women\n2.\t\u2060Black people\n3.\t\u2060Latino voters/Puerto Ricans\n4.\t\u2060Veterans and\n5.\t\u2060Legal Immigrants and their families.\n\nThe strategy of insults, threats and intimidation to attract voters is counterintuitive but we\u2019re talking Trump so I\u2019ll call it the \u201cSTUPID STRATEGY.\u201d\n\nTrump loses overall because people are tired of the hate, lies, chaos and division for the last 9 years. People are exhausted.\n\nThe irony is that as much as his base has delighted in Trump\u2019s insults and offensive language against women, people of color and others; come election night they will be very disappointed to see how his divisive and hateful rhetoric has negatively impacted the votes of those groups he desperately needed.\n\nSo now it\u2019s time for my prediction. \nI\u2019ve been pretty accurate so far in my observations and predictions lately.\n\nMy posts calling for Biden to step down were wildly unpopular among Democrats due to his unfitness for office.  Who cares?  Harris is a fit candidate and I\u2019m all aboard.\n\nConversely my posts calling for Trump\u2019s rejection on the grounds of his unfitness for the office are also unpopular for the Trump supporters.\n\nWho cares? It\u2019s a moot point. I predict the Trump shit show is OVER!  Good riddance!\n\nSo here\u2019s my prediction of the final electoral vote outcome:  Harris 314- 224.  Good luck everybody! \n",

We've been closely watching the presidential election play out and written extensively about the Trump and Harris campaigns. Today, we\u2019ll dive into Trump's victory and what to expect next. Ask us anything!\n\nFrom Charles: I write about national politics, public opinion and social justice, with a focus on racial equality and L.G.B.T.Q. rights. I\u2019ve been a columnist at Opinion since 2008. I am a political analyst for MSNBC, and I live in Atlanta. Recently, I explained how\u00a0[Trump has embraced vulgarity](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/opinion/donald-trump-arnold-palmer.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Uk4.vKwf.QXHqrtsji93e&smid=re-nytopinion)\u00a0to exploit the gender gap among particularly young voters.\n\nFrom Lydia Polgreen: I write about the world, culture and politics, with an emphasis on human rights, migration, queer lives and democracy. I spent a decade as an international correspondent for The Times in West Africa, South Asia and South Africa. \u201cWhether Harris wins or loses, it is hard to escape the feeling that the past year has produced a tragic victory for Trump\u2019s scapegoating of Muslims, leaving many Arab and Muslim Americans feeling expendable,\u201d\u00a0[I argue in a recent column](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/02/opinion/trump-harris-gaza-arab-americans.html?unlocked_article_code=1.XU4.6GoJ.GObL5CZTdjyB&smid=re-nytopinion).\n\nFrom Michelle Cottle: I recently reflected on some of the most\u00a0[defining moments of this campaign season](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/opinion/election-trump-harris-campaign-review.html?unlocked_article_code=1.XU4.gPP2.LHaWyXCgbtne&smid=re-nytopinion), from Donald Trump\u2019s indictments to Project 2025. I have covered Washington since the Clinton administration and am a host of \u201cMatter of Opinion,\u201d a weekly podcast where I discuss a singular topic with my colleagues.\n\nWe\u2019ll start answering questions at 12 p.m. E.T. on Wednesday, November 6th.\n\nProof:\u00a0\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/charles-blow-reddit-ama-11-6-7ZYzvT8](https://imgur.com/gallery/charles-blow-reddit-ama-11-6-7ZYzvT8)\u00a0\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/lydia-polgreen-reddit-ama-11-6-LG8YI1S](https://imgur.com/gallery/lydia-polgreen-reddit-ama-11-6-LG8YI1S)\u00a0\n\n[https://imgur.com/gallery/michelle-cottle-reddit-ama-11-6-eAutEXz](https://imgur.com/gallery/michelle-cottle-reddit-ama-11-6-eAutEXz)",

But Muslims, Arabs, Pro Palestinians are defending it instead of condemning it. They could have either gone the legal way to keep working at solution or gone at war in an honorable way but they CHOSE terrorism. \n\nSo now US bound by its agreement, open supporter of Israel acting on its promise is the only villain and everyone living in it - immigrants, women of reproductive age, people speaking in favor of Palestine - all need to suffer Trump era. \n\nWhy are you all not condemning Hamas\u2019 terrorism but are calling everyone else a genocidal monster?",

When referring to Trump\u2019s statements-which were so often filled with malice and bigotry and rested on a foundation of lies-they removed the context, dropped the fact-checks, and made it seem pretty normal. \n\nAnd so here we are. Millions of democrats didn\u2019t vote, or split the ticket and voted for Trump. Project 2025 will defund public media, prop up algorithm-fueled social media, and democracy dies in silence. \n\nI would love to hear NPR cover Trump\u2019s Agenda47.

Today on Morning Edition I heard a segment talking about how it's Election Day and making a point that the last presidential election was marred by numerous lawsuits that didn't go anywhere and an attempted coup with fake electors.\n\nToday NPR had a discussion of how the 2020 election was not in fact stolen and highlighting Donald Trump's previous refusal to concede an election that was by all accounts free and fair. This is just the type of journalism needed. Calling out NPR for a job well done, especially on Election Day.\n\n[https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5172354/even-before-all-the-votes-are-counted-trump-is-expected-to-make-fraud-claims](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/05/nx-s1-5172354/even-before-all-the-votes-are-counted-trump-is-expected-to-make-fraud-claims)\n\n\\-----\n\n**EDIT: Some of you seem to be under the impression this was the first time during this election cycle that NPR has brought these issues up. This is far from correct. This post merely highlights they are continuing this coverage into Election Day itself rather than trying to feign neutrality like some news outlets by papering over the substantive differences between the candidates and the parties.**",

        "title": "NPR's Failure to Understand What Their Audience Meant by Wanting More Diverse Perspectives",
        "selftext": "As frequenters of this subreddit are surely aware, there has been a wave of rather unhappy NPR listeners who have found the recent coverage of Trump disconcerting.  This represents a marked change in their coverage from just earlier this year.  No obvious reason for this shift presents itself beside the obvious self-interested goal of expanding and maintaining their market share.  I think that is has become readily apparent that they have blunder in their attempts to accomplish this.\n\nIt's no secret that [NPR's listenership has been declining](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/public-broadcasting/) and regardless of your position his piece [Uri Berliner's ](https://www.thefp.com/p/npr-editor-how-npr-lost-americas-trust)recent criticism represents some degree of internal friction and echos the concerns of a non-insignificant number of listeners.  It was not so shortly after Berliner's ill-advised slight of his employer, and subsequent resignation, that the above mentioned changes began to become apparent.  I don't think this establishes causation, but I do think the general spirit of Berliner's argument is a contributing factor to NPR's recent shift.  If this is the case, then NPR completely fumbled this course correction.\n\nAs I see it, the prior criticism of NPR was that they didn't offer diverse \\*rational\\* perspectives on issues, \\*\\*not\\*\\*  that they didn't represent the absolutely logically bereft positions of the far-right.\n\nAn example of this being a balanced reporting on Gaza, which they have hitherto largely lacked.  A segment that aired two weeks ago comes to mind, about how Palestinian shopkeepers were experiencing a loss of customers in the wake of Oct 7th as a result of growing anti-Palestinian sentiments.  However, no attention was paid toward the Israeli motivations, and it was just insinuated that it was prejudicial or racism.  While that is certainly part of it, NPR completely failed to mention that Palestinian workers \\*in Israel\\* participated in and helped organize the acts of October 7th.  This information is very important to understanding the tensions between these two groups.  Do Israelis feel betrayed?  Is that why they avoid Palestinian owned business? Perhaps, but I don't know because NPR didn't do a good job of reporting \\*diverse rational perspectives\\*.\n\nAnother example would be the post Depp-Heard trial, where the interview focused exclusively on the harm that the trial would do to people's belief in women's claims of sexual or physical harassment.  That is a very good point and deserves attention, however so does the insidiousness of some women using such claims as tools of retribution or to enrich themselves. Additionally, some men certainly were unfairly harmed by potentially fictitious claims, like Johnny Depp.  But NPR didn't present those considerations.\n\nThese, and many more, and examples of reporting where I think NPR is lacking a diverse perspective.\n\nThey do not, in my opinion, need to explore the completely irrational pits of the right-wing conspiracy theorists, as they have been.  They had a lady on two weeks ago saying that her daughter-in-law \\*to-be\\* said that FEMA was slowing down the recovery process in North Carolina.  That is not the kind diverse perspective NPR needed to explore.",

I get it trump was cruel to cage the minors and separated families, we wouldn\u2019t do that, but not just let them pour in either. I think this is an issue that the far left side loud mouths pushed and Biden admin failed badly and lost a lot support for that, only to reverse it too late. I just don\u2019t get it why didn\u2019t they find a way to stop the flow. It\u2019s not easy but the reality is it\u2019s a huge liability and they have no choice but to stop the flow sooner or later, yet sooner would be better.",

Totally ignoring that that there are plenty of Black working class, blue collar votes who  voted overwhelmingly for Harris. Somehow THEY cared despite many struggling financially.

The AP doesn't \"declare\" crap. The election isn't over until all valid ballots are counted and certified. Several states don't even start counting absentee ballots until tomorrow. One doesn't until Saturday. We are currently sitting at less than the total 2016 turnout, and I find it hard to believe that with a larger pool of eligible voters, with all the exhortations to get out the vote, with everything that's at stake, with all the reports of record early and same-day voting... that we have anything close to the full picture. There are very probably a good thirty million or more ballots that aren't showing up in the returns yet and it's going to be weeks before the states verify and certify the results.\n\nAnd somehow the AP gets to declare the winner on Election Day and the NPR newsroom just rolls with it? Harris doesn't plan to concede until every vote is counted. NOR shouldn't, either.",

This is like blaming the victim. How do you reason with people that are in a cult? They don\u2019t want to hear the facts. You show them proof of something. They absolutely don\u2019t believe it. You show them a photo, it was Photoshopped. Of course Willie chimes in about how right Joe is. Bottom line is you can\u2019t reason with people who don\u2019t want to hear. Many wanted a reason to vote for hate and they found that reason in Trump. Others want to be rich and powerful like Trump so he got their vote too. Bottom line is Kamala ran a great campaign and would have been a far more competent president but the people didn\u2019t care. Stop blaming her and her campaign for that. ",

Kamala got 13+ million less votes than Biden, and she ran an incredible campaign! Picked the absolute best VP running mate, had massive rallies, huge support, popular speakers, and her message was clear, repeatable, and hopeful. \n\nI\u2019m very aware that way too much of our country is sexiest, racist, xenophobic, and rooted in white supremacy. I\u2019m also aware that Kamala wasn\u2019t very well liked in the 2020 primaries, and it took some time for her to get rolling once Biden dropped out, but I was really ready for an even bigger turnout for her than 2020. \n\nOne thing I think we can all agree on is that so much of the accusations Republicans throw out there (especially MAGAts), is quite often projection. They\u2019ve been crying voter fraud, election interference, and rigged for 4 years, so I can\u2019t help but wonder if they orchestrated a way to not count millions of votes. I remember hearing how the GOP was training Trump loyalists to be poll workers, and they had a group organize that training maybe a year or so back. I know 13 million is a huge number, but a few hundred ballots in thousands of counties could be plausible. Am I taking crazy pills, or still in the denial phase, and turnout really was terrible?

        "selftext": "I feel the need to express my extreme disappointment in a statement Lawrence O'Donnell made last evening on Jen Psake\u2019s show about not voting. In discussing the presidential vote in the context of the Electoral College, O'Donnell told voters in non-battleground states their votes were meaningless and the EC itself was a voter suppression construct. While this election is, indeed, focusing on the presidential race, the many races up and down the ballot absolutely *do* affect governance. Local and state legislators affect our daily lives in a much more immediate and profound way than our representatives in Washington do. As well, a President Trump, with a solidly democratic House and Senate, might be unable to pursue some items on his frightening agenda.\n\nEven if a presidential vote is not dispositive given the Red/Blue complexion of their state, down ballot votes mean a lot and must be considered equally important to each and every voter across the US.\n\nWhile it\u2019s too late to retract\u2014or at least modify\u2014this statement for the current election,  please in the future emphasize the importance of all elected officials, whatever their level of government.",

And I\u2019m worried that no one wants to acknowledge that the Third Reich also held \u201cdeportations\u201d that were in actuality just rounding people up for killing. They tried to disguise their intentions by referring to deportations as \"resettlement to the east.\" The victims were told they were to be taken to labor camps, but in reality, from 1942 onward, deportation for most Jews meant transit to killing centers and then death.\n\nWhite supremacy is what guides and drives the government coming to power. Trump idolizes Hitler and I think we need to take his firing squad comments very seriously. I fear that when they realize the logistics of mass deportation, they\u2019ll just start killing people en masse. ",
